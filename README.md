# Dice-Game
I have made a simple Dice-Game just for fun using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it can be played by two users, the game resets itself after refreshing the browser. The player which has larger number on it's dice wins the game. To run the website, just download the files and open "dicee.html" using any browser.
